# osu!lazer SkinDebloater
## Deletes unnecessary files from skins that are not needed in osu!lazer.
## Terminal Version Dependencies
You only need Python
## GUI Version Dependencies
Python and CustomTkinter
### How to install customtkinter?
Open cmd and type
`pip install customtkinter`

## Recent changes:
Added a GUI Version
Completely revamped the backup feature (Now it copies the folder and makes changes in a copied folder automatically (note: In the GUI version it is not done automatically and you have to click on the "Backup Skin" button))
## Things I'm working on
Just making the code not shit
## Editor notes
I don't like having stuff I don't need and I noticed that a lot of elements from old osu! skins are (for now?) unusable in the new osu!lazer client.

Anyone is free to contribute but that most likely won't ever happen sooooo :3.
