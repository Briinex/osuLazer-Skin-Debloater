# osu!lazer SkinDebloater
Deletes unnecessary files from skins that are not needed in osu!lazer
I don't like having stuff I don't need and I noticed that a lot of elements from old osu! skins are (for now?) unusable in the new osu!lazer client.
I plan to make this script way more usable

Recent changes:
ADDED A GUI VERSION - Tkinter

You need to have python install (preferably > 3.9 ver)

Anyone is free to contribute to my project but that most likely won't ever happen sooooo :3.
